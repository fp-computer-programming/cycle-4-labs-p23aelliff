#Getting first and last name from input of user.
fist_name = input("Aidan")
last_name = input("Elliff")

#Printing full name of user, did get some result.
print(fist_name + last_name)

#I am getting the inputs frgamented between two diferent runs.
#It can be fix by potentially making the print a string or similar command.
